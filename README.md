# Fruits_vegs_prediction
this is a trained ML model for the fruits and vegs predictions
Overview
This project focuses on building a neural network model to classify images of fruits and vegetables. The primary objective is to develop an accurate classification system capable of distinguishing between different types of fruits and vegetables based on input images.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project consists of images of various fruits and vegetables. The dataset is organized into training and validation sets. Each image is labeled with its corresponding class, allowing the model to learn to differentiate between different types of produce.

Training Set
Total Images: 3848
Classes: 3
Validation Set
Total Images: 353
Classes: 36
Key Findings
During the course of this project, several key findings were made:

The model achieved a satisfactory level of accuracy in classifying images of fruits and vegetables.
Training the model involved preprocessing the dataset, defining and compiling the neural network architecture, and evaluating its performance.
Challenges such as overfitting and class imbalance were addressed through appropriate techniques such as data augmentation and class weighting.
Instructions
To run the notebook and train the model:

Clone the repository from GitHub to your local machine.
Open the train_veges&fruits.ipynb notebook using Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.
Ensure that you have access to the required libraries and dependencies.
Execute each cell in the notebook sequentially to mount Google Drive, import the dataset, define and train the model, and evaluate its performance.
Save the trained model for future use.
To load the saved model:

Ensure that the necessary libraries are imported.
Load the saved model using tf.keras.models.load_model() function.
Use the loaded model for inference or further training.
